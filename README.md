# 🔁 Probabilistic Sequence Models

This project demonstrates sequence modeling using **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** and the **Viterbi algorithm**, a foundational method for inferring hidden state sequences based on observed data.

These methods are widely used in NLP tasks like part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and speech recognition.
